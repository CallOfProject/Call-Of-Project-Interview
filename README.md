# Call-Of-Project Interview Part

## Overview

The Call-Of-Project Interview Part enables project owners to conduct coding and test interviews as part of their projects. This feature allows users to participate in interviews, showcasing their problem-solving skills and knowledge in various programming languages. Interview part is not focus part for our project but it is important part.

## Features

1. **Coding Interview:**
   - Project owners can create coding interviews with prepared questions.
   - Users receive email invitations to participate in coding interviews.
   - Participants are expected to complete and submit the interview within a specified time frame.
   - If the interview is not submitted within the time limit, the system automatically submits the code written by the participant.
   - Project owners can view users' responses and manage interview results.

2. **Test Interview:**
   - Similar to coding interviews, project owners can create test interviews with predefined questions and correct answers.
   - Users can participate in test interviews via email invitations.
   - Participants must solve each question before proceeding to the next one, and they cannot return to previous questions.
   - After completion, users submit the test interview, and results are communicated via email.
   - Project owners have access to users' responses and scores.

3. **Interview Management:**
   - Project owners can delete interviews if needed.
   - Interviews cannot be edited after submission, but this feature may be added if sufficient time allows.
